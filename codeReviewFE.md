## Code Review

- I would rather call the folder from "views" to "pages".
- In the components folder, I would also create a separate folder for each component, where I would store the component itself and styles for it.
- In the project, we do not have any code formatter like eslint or prettier.
- In the search page getStringValue is let but it should be const. Also, it looks like a helper, so it rather makes folder helpers and moves it to separate file and import from.
- Also, we have many states and requests inside components if our project scales it rather use redux library for making thunks and holding state.
- In our project we have both inline styles and separated CSS files, it rather makes it in one way, I prefer module CSS with preprocessors like SCSS or styledComponent and avoid inline styles.
- In interfaces or typing props we can see 'any', they should be avoided as much as possible. _In some places we expect a number (we multiply) and could recive anything because type is any, in the future, this can break the logic._
- Also, i prefer to make a separate folder and files for global object types.
- Some of the elements created by react.createElement, other like JSX, but renders inside if, it rather do it in "render" in JSX way and conditional rendering component without using if else.
- Also in a project we have useEffect without dependencies, etc.
- For axios, I would create a separate folder with files where you can make basic settings (set headers, base URL, connect the interceptor in the future)
- There was no file example.env, it needs to be created and no gitignored so that the new developer knows what it should be and what constants it contains.
  PS - _In general, many places in the code can be improved, I described more global things, but there are also many trivial nuances_
