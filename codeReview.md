Incorrect project structure, I would rather call the folder "views" to "pages". In the components folder, I would also create a separate folder for each component, where I would store the component itself and styles for it. In the project, we do not have any code formatter like eslint or prettier. In the search page getStringValue is let but it should be const. Also, we have many states and requests inside components if our project scales it rather use redux library for making thunks and holding state. In our project we have both inline styles and separated CSS files, it rather makes it in one way, I prefer module CSS and avoid inline styles. In interfaces or typing props we can see 'any', they should be avoided as much as possible. Also, i prefer to make a separate folder and files for global object types. Some of the elements created by react.createElement, other like JSX, but renders inside if, it rather do it in "render" in JSX way and conditional rendering component without using if else. Also in a project we have useEffect without dependencies, etc.
